# WeatherApp

This app has two different directories: "client" and "server".
Clone the repository with following command (you have to have git installed):

```bash

git clone https://github.com/UP957155/WeatherApp.git

```

Then go to the "server" directory and install dependencies and run it (server should run on port 8080):

```bash

cd server
npm install
npm start

```

Same process with "client" directory (Before run commands be sure you are in the WeatherApp directory. Be sure you don't stop server through this process):

```bash

cd client
npm install
npm start

```

You should then use app via client-side.

Enjoy!!!
